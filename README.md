# C-race-simulation-game-
Little C project to simulate a race between a hare and a tortoise
The race takes place on a track of 70 positions, and both the hare and the tortoise move based on random numbers generated in each turn.
The race continues until either the hare or the tortoise reaches or exceeds the 70th position
Although it is a simple project, I really enjoyed making this
